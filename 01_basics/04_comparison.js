// In javascript, comparison operators  and equality work differently.
// The comparison operators include: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=
// The == operator checks for value equality, while === strict checks for both value and type equality.

console.log(null == 0); // false
console.log(null >= 0); // true
